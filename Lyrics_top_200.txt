Put your loving hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, darling
Riding high, when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, but you warned me then
But easy come, and easy go, and it would end
So, any time I bleed, you let me go
Yeah, any time I feed, you get me know
Any time I seek, you let me know
But I plan and see, just let me go
I'm on my knees while I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't want to lose you
Hey yeah, ratatata
'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
And put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
And put your loving hand out, darling
I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again
An empty shell
I used to be
The shadow of my life was hanging over me
A broken man
That I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's chance to win my soul
What we doing? What we chasing?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a picture telling where we could be at
Like a heart ain't attached the way it should
You can give it away, you had, and you took the pay
But I keep walking on
Keep opening doors
Keep hoping for
That the call is yours
Keep calls on hold
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
Girl, I'm begging
Mmm, ye-e-e-ah
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, darling
I'm fighting hard
To hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holding on
I can't fall back
I'm just a calm 'bout to fade to black
I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, darling
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, darling
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out
I do the same thing I told you that I never would

Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (oh)

When I'm away from you, I miss your touch (ooh-ooh)
You're the reason I believe in love
It's been difficult for me to trust (ooh-ooh)
And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up
Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
'Cause you ain't ever left me empty-handed
And you know that I know that I can't live without you
So, baby, stay
Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl, and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world? (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl
Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
Not me, if you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want (ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off (ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ha)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you?
Well, screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do
Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
Not me, if you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it

Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotionalOne, two, three, four
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Every time you come around you know I can't say no
Every time the Sun goes down I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won't
I've got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was looking for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothing happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you (oh-oh, oh-oh)
My bad habits lead to you (oh-oh, oh-oh)
My bad habits lead to you
Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Falling over everything to reach the first times spark
Started under neon lights then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far (woh)

If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby

The Milky Way, we're renegading

We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars
You want me, I want you, baby

Ahora e' con otro con quien vacilo en la pista, ey
Ay, José, no me insista'
Das muchas vuelta', parece' motociclista (ey)
Ninguna con este porte
Tengo este booty sin hacer deporte (no, no, no)
Nada va a hacer que me importe'
Porque mi brújula ya cambió su norte (¡Wuh!)
Cambió desde que te fuiste tú
Papi, eso lo sabe' muy bien
No me venga' con esa actitud
Que esa la conozco yo también
Y ahora no ando soltera para ti, no, ey

Ninguna cabe en tu size
Saca un rato; que estás sola, ya me dieron el dato (dato)
Dame el PIN, yo te caigo de inmediato (inmediato)
Ellos intentan y yo ni trato
Baby, esto ya es otra liga, pero tú estás por encima, ey
Vamo' a hacerlo, aprovecha el clima (J Balvin)
Tú estás bien diva, y ese cuerpo que motiva, baby
Vamos a hacerlo, que está rico el clima
¿Qué más pues? ¿Cómo te ha ido?
Tú sigues siendo el mismo engreído
No es personal, pa' novio no has nacido
Me tuviste mucho tiempo, fuiste distraído
Y ahora, ¿qué más pues? Me he ido
Ya es suficiente lo que tú ha' comido (ah)
Aunque no parezca, esto me ha dolido
Y de lo pasado yo no me olvido
Regálame otra noche, quiero verte (verte, verte)

Tú de vacacione' en Boston y otro apareció primero
Y me está' empalagando y eso que no e' golosina
Tú mucho me está' mirando y eso que no soy vitrina
It’s the thought of being young
When your heart’s just like a drum
Beating louder with no way to guard it
When it all seems like it’s wrong
Just sing along to Elton John
And to that feeling, we’re just getting started

When the nights get colder
And the rhythms got you falling behind
Just dream about that moment
When you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eye
Then you say

I wanna dance
The music’s got me going
Ain’t nothing that can stop how we move yeah
Let’s break our plans
And live just like we’re golden
And roll in like we’re dancing fools

We don’t need to worry
‘Cause when we fall we know how to land
Don’t need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
‘Cause we don’t need permission to dance

There’s always something that’s standing in the way
But if you don’t let it faze ya
You’ll know just how to break
Just keep the right vibe yeah
‘Cause there’s no looking back
There ain’t no one to prove
We don’t got this on lock yeah

The wait is over
The time is now so let’s do it right
Yeah we’ll keep going
And stay up until we see the sunrise
And we’ll say

I wanna dance
The music’s got me going
Ain’t nothing that can stop how we move yeah
Let’s break our plans
And live just like we’re golden
And roll in like we’re dancing fools

We don’t need to worry
‘Cause when we fall we know how to land
Don’t need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
‘Cause we don’t need permission to dance

Da na na na na na na

Well let me show ya
That we can keep the fire alive
‘Cause it’s not over
Till it’s over say it one more time
Say

I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)

And I say, oh (Oh)
The way I breathe you in (In)
It's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh

It's the way you lift me up, yeah

All I can want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There's no time, I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I'm in Mallorca
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn't hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa

Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, oh
Done bein' distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (Oh)
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time

Side step, right-left, to my beat

Ain't no other that can sweep you up like a robber
Straight up, I (got ya)
Making you fall like that (break it down)
Ooh, when I look in the mirror

Side step, right-left, to my beat
Get it, let it roll
Get it, let it roll

Ice on my wrist, I'm that nice guy
Got that right body and that right mind
Rolling up to party, got the right vibe

Fresh, boy, pull up and we lay low
All the players get moving when the bass low
Got ARMY right behind us when we say so
Let's go

Ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Brown guilty eyes and little white lies
Yeah, I played dumb but I always knew
That you'd talk to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you
And ain't it funny
How you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny
How you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You'd talk to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter
It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor
Now you bring her around
Just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true
There's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly
Ain't it funny
All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid?
Ain't it funny?
Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You'd talk to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter
It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
(Ah-ah-ah)
When she's sleeping in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way
You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You'd talk to her
When we were together
You gave me your word
But that didn't matter
It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still
You're still a traitor (ah-ah-ah)
Yeah, you're still a traitor
Ooh-ooh-ooh
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream
One spoon for two
And trading jackets
Laughing 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Being annoying
Singing in harmony
I bet she's bragging
To all her friends, saying you're so unique, hmm
So when you gonna tell her
That we did that too?
She thinks it's special
But it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah), hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
Do you call her
Almost say my name?
'Cause let's be honest
We kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
I'll bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her Uptown Girl
You're singing it together
Now I bet you even tell her
How you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (ooh) (I love you)
So when you gonna tell her
That we did that too?
She thinks it's special
But it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the song she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? Oh
Do you get déjà vu?
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit too
You're trading jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
(I know you get déjà vu)
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vuYeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
You could have asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
So I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time
I don't know why I run away
Oh girl, I make you cry when I run away
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (ooh, yeah)
Save your tears for another day (yeah)
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Save your tears for another day, ooh girl (ah)
I said save your tears for another day, yeah (ah)
Save your tears for another day (ah)
Save your tears for another day (ah)

Disfruto el poder verte aunque no sea conmigo, no, ey
Tengo que conformarme con ser solo tu amigo
Siempre pensando en tu nombre, vivo distraído
Por fin me enamoré y resulta que es prohibido
Más adelante vive gente, pero no me he movido
Sigo estancao, siempre soñando contigo

El DM explotao, pero las dejo en leído
Mis letras siempre tienen tu nombre y apellido
Viviendo con mil preguntas, el lápiz sin punta
De todo lo que escribo, ma, tú tienes la culpa
Llevo un año pagando la misma multa
Tú eres ese mal que no sé por qué me gusta
El no poder olvidarte me frustra
Te lo juro que me frustra

Pero, si me llamas, le llego volando
En la Mercedes voy capsuleando
Y, cuando no estás, te sigo imaginando
Sin ropa en mi cama, mi nombre gritando

Y, si me llamas, le llego volando
En la Mercedes voy capsuleando
Y, cuando no estás, te sigo imaginando
Sin ropa en mi cama, mi nombre gritando

Voy volando aunque sufra de vértigo
Y, si me caigo, no tengo un plan médico
Con tus cenotes yo me siento en México
Contigo el doctor me medicó, así que vente
Olvida el pasado que el futuro lo tienes de frente
Eso lo mantiene un por siempre
Pero yo le llego, solo dime

Que no me vaya
Cuéntame si tiro la toalla
O si la tiramos en la playa
Baby, voy volando por si la señal me falla

Y, si me llamas, le llego volando
En la Mercedes voy capsuleando
Y, cuando no estás, te sigo imaginando
Sin ropa en mi cama, mi nombre gritando

Y, si me llama', yo le caigo en la AMG
Baby, pa' terminar lo que a mitad dejé
En la cama hicimos una serie, pero no PG
Y aunque me alejé
Sigo viendo tu cara cuando a otra se lo pongo
Si todavía tengo tu wallpaper de fondo
Ando sin salvavidas nadando en lo hondo
Ya siento tus latidos aunque me quede sordo

Y, dime tú, cómo es que se sana este dolor
Si ya lavé las sábanas, pero siguen con tu olor
Y yo solo pido sentir de nuevo tu calor
Ya probé unas cuantas, pero extraño tu sabor

Ey, si tú me llamas, yo le llego mas rápido que emergencias
Pa' ti no hay competencia
Cuando tú llegas, se siente la diferencia
¿Será una maldición o coincidencia?

Con ese culote y esa carita
Tú eres la mami favorita
Si estuviésemo' en kínder, te enviaba cartita'
Llevo to' el día en la playa pa' ver si se me quita

La' estrella' te ven y piden un deseo
Baby, tú tienes algo que yo solo veo
Ya no quiero más premio', no quiero más trofeo'
Yo lo único que pido es mañana verte de nuevo

Aunque sea con él
El cielo en el infierno, nadie va a entender
Huyendo 'e lo que siento, me cansé de correr
En mis ojos se nota, no lo puedo esconder

Que, si tú me llamas, le llego volando
A la hora que tú digas, no importa dónde y cuándo
Y, cuando no estás, te sigo imaginando
Tu alma con la mía, los dos juntos vibrando, ey
Man
This happened one, two, three times too much
These dumb-ass niggas
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
You can say that again
Niggas is square like Madison
I can't even really get mad at them
They fall, then I gotta facepalm
Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassing
Ten-page text, should've wrote a book, could've made a bag
But he broke and he still waiting 'til I can chill
And he really think I'ma get back to him
Doing too much, relax a bit
Acting like that 'cause your dad's a bitch
Must be the way that the planets is
Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick
I'm a freak, not a masochist
Should've known you had the baddest bitch
Left on read and can't give head
Really, you ain't shit, need a laxative
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Said that's not cheating if I wasn't with your ass, yo
You kept secrets and your cousin told me that, so (your cousin)
Logical thinking is just something that you lack, so
What you even mad for? Looking like a stick up in your asshole
I'm not your mommy, nigga, find a new hobby, nigga
Return, yo, 'fore I get picked up, your shit's in the lobby, nigga
I'm not gon' key your car, I'll call your fucking mom
You should have paid my rent, go get a fucking job
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
Today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
'Cause you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Road shimmer

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put
Something on TV
So we never think
About you and me
But today I see
Our reflections
Clearly in Hollywood
Laying on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need something I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now the night has come but
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
You can't fight it
You can't breathe
You say something so loving but
Now I've got to let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreaming of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Heat waves been faking me out
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Road shimmer
Wiggling the vision
Heat heat waves
I'm swimming in a mirror
Yeah
I've been tryin' to call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
And I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
(Hey, hey, hey)
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
The city's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
And I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (ooh)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
(Hey, hey, hey)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
We broke up a month ago
Your friends aren't mine, you know, I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was attached
For all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?
Oh, I hope you're happy, but not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed you meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind, she probably gives you butterflies
I hope you're happy, but not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, I wish you all the best, really
Say you love her, baby, just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I hope you're happy, just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go
So find someone great, don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
I do not care what people say about me
Life you your life, that I live mine
That is only one, enjoy the moment
That time is running out and no turning back
Drinking, smoking and fucking
I keep hesitating from party to 'los dia'
Follow him, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (Farru)
Follow him, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh- oh (the roll and pepa)
Pepa and water for the dry

Falling out, in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pouring down (pouring down)
See, that pain was all around

Didn't know which-which way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge

Both hands together, God, let me pray (now let me pray)

Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimming in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign

They say that I'm so fine
You could never match my grind
Please do not, not waste my time

Rose petals in the bathtub

Oh, my love, oh, yeah, yeah
I'm in love, yeah
I replayed this moment for months
Alone in my head waitin' for it to come
I wrote all your lines in the script in my mind
And I'd hoped that you'd follow it for once
I imagined myself in satin, the room was platinum and gold
I'd dance and catch your eye, you'd be mesmerized, oh
We'd find a corner there, your hands in my hair
Finally we're here, so why
Sayin' you got a flight, need an early night? No
Don't go yet
Oh yeah, don't go yet
Don't go yet
Oh yeah, don't go yet
Don't go yet
Oh yeah, don't go yet
Don't go yet
What you leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Just a little more, don't go yet
Baby, don't go yet 'cause I wore this dress for a little drama
And I bet, I bet that you think that you know, but you don't, baby, come to mama
I get, I get what I want when I want, and I get it how I wanna-wanna
And I want you, baby, gotta get you, baby
We'd find a corner there, your hands in my hair
Finally we're here, so why
Sayin' you got a flight, need an early night, no
Don't go yet
Oh yeah, don't go yet
Don't go yet
Oh yeah, don't go yet
Don't go yet
Oh yeah, don't go yet
Don't go yet

Just a little more, don't go yet
Dámelo

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (don't go yet)

Just a little more
What you leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Yours, yours
What you leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Just a little more, don't go yet
Know that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice, honey
And I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody
Those things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends
And now, every time a siren sounds
I wonder if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again
All the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
It's bittersweet to think about the damage that we do
'Cause I was going down, but I was doing it with you
Yeah, everything we broke, and all the trouble that we made
But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face
Oh, look what we became
All the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
All the things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
Your favorite crime
Your favorite crime
'Cause baby, you were mine
Woh-oh (Yeah)
Woh-oh (Myke Towers)
Mmm-mmm (Yatra, Yatra)
Qué tan loco sería
Si yo fuera el dueño de tu corazón por solo un día
Si nos gana la alegría, yo por fin te besaría
¿Qué pasaría?
Podría ser entre él y yo, ¿quién ganaría?
Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño
Y el no tenerte me hace daño
Seríamo' la pareja del año
Cuánto te extraño
Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía
Y mis amigos lo sabían
Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías
Si me dieran solo veinticuatro hora', yo la' aprovecho
Jura'o que yo voy a hacerte cosa' que nunca te han hecho
Ya yo me cansé de ser amigo' con derecho'
Yo tal ve' no te merezco, pero no hay ni que decirlo
Si no' juntamo' seríamo' la pareja del siglo
Con ella acapella me da con introducirlo
Navaja doble filo
Cortamo' y lo' video' me dio con reproducirlo'
Me lo decían, yo los ignoraba
Simplemente todo ahora quedó en la nada
Se lo hacía y a los ojo' la miraba
Yo nunca creía que el amor cegaba
Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño
Y no tenerte me hace daño
Seríamo' la pareja del año
Cuánto te extraño
Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía
Y mis amigos lo sabían
Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías
Asumí mi depresión de ver una foto tuya
Y verte en la televisión puede ser que me destruya la mente
Detente, como dice la canción
Que no meten preso a nadie por robarse un corazón
Sufriendo, llorando de pena
Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena
Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelvas
Te vuelves la mala de nuestra novela
Me tienes sufriendo, llorando de pena
Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena
Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas
Me quitas la pista y me quedo acapella
Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño
Y el no tenerte me hace daño
Seríamo' la pareja del año
Cuánto te extraño
Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía
Y mis amigos lo sabían
Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías
Yo tenía otra melodía
De lo que resultaría
Maldita monotonía
¿Fue culpa tuya o fue culpa mía? (Seríamo' la pareja del año)
Yo aprendí a vivir con celos (Con celos)
Tú aprendiste a no ser mía (No, oh)
Solo queda ser sincero
Yo te quiero todavía
Tastes like strawberries
On a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries
And that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
Strawberries on a summer evenin'

This from the heart, real shit, I'm on top, on top
Yeah, yeah
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
They tryna bring me down, gotta stay focused
When I get sad, I get the Hennessy and pour up
Fuck dirty Sprite, I get the liquor and the cola
And fuck my ex-bitch, she did me dirty, I got no trust
I was only young, but I learned that these hoes ain't shit
I gave you my heart, and this the thanks I get?
I still can't believe all of the things I did
I still can't believe that you would leave like this
Traumatized from the shit I've seen in my life
Everything you see right now is the highlight
No matter how hard I try, memories still livin' deep in my mind
I seen my best friends change colors like the tie-dye
Shout out to the ones that still with me, those are my guys
And fuck everybody else that's just talking from the sidelines
Seein' it and livin' it, bitch, there is a fine line
And R.I.P. my brother, never got to say bye-bye
It gets hard, I know, believe it
I hope you find the help you're seeking
I was down in Hell, believe me
Packed up my bags and told the devil I'm leaving
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, I can't fold up
Be so sick, you lose a soldier, wanna throw up
I kept seein' all your pictures every time I scroll up
Now when we see a nigga, get him, quick to let that pole bust
Cali cruisin' in that i8 with the doors up
Now we winnin', 'member back then, they never chose us
Now them bitches doin' backbends, givin' throat up
And I keep collectin' backends, 'cause they owed us
I was really tryna find a way up in them streets lost
Don't be in my feelings really, I just be in deep thoughts
And it been fuck the opposites, no, we don't do the peace talk
Foenem come through rockin' shit, and that's another beat caught
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
I get lost up in my feelings in this Wraith, so I just look at the stars
Like, "Goddamn, we done made it this far"
This shit a blessing, nigga
'Cause I remember we was broke, they weren't messin' with us
I had to make my own way, I manifested, nigga
I dropped two-fifty on a Urus, ain't no Tesla, nigga
And it's still fuck the opps, I just don't be addressin' niggas
The feds screamin' out indictments, they collectin' niggas, mm
Left me heartless, but I'm glad that it's over
No more cryin' on my shoulder
Pour up the Hennessy
'Cause I hate bein' sober, mm
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Uh (Tuned up)
Copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like, "Fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it"
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I've been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished
Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder can you hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills but I know it ain't gon'
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like, "Fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it"
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I've been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (uh, uh)
And we might have a child when I'm finished
They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Weren't puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy T-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just wanna leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Tryna explain your feelings sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar, for every battle I fought
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like, "Fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it"
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?

And we might have a child when I'm finished
When I'm finished
When I'm finished

Turning up emotional faders
Keep repeating self-hating phrases
I have heard enough of these voices
Almost like I have no choice
This is biological stasis
My mood's shifting too manic places
Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
Watch life, here I go again
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry
This is the end (ooh)
My biggest enemy is me
Pop a 911

Pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me
Ever since day one
Pop a 911
Then pop another one
Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes
Save them 'til I know I'm gon' drop this
Front I've built me around my oasis
Paradise is in my hand
Holding on so tight to this status
It's not real but I'll try to grab it
Keep myself in beautiful places
Paradise is in my hands
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry
This is the end (ooh)
My biggest enemy is me
Pop a 911

I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
Wish I didn't care
I know that beauty is not my lack
But it feels like that weight is on my back
And I can't let it go
Co-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think, I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
But jealousy, jealousy
Started followin' me (he-he-he, he-he)
Started followin' me (he-he-he, he-he)
And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want
And I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not
Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos
I can't stand it, oh, God, I sound crazy
Their win is not my loss
I know it's true
But I can't help gettin' caught up in it all
Co-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think, I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
But jealousy, jealousy (yeah)
All your friends are so cool, you go out every night
In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're livin' the life
Got a pretty face, pretty boyfriend, too
I wanna be you so bad, and I don't even know you
All I see is what I should be
Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy
All I see is what I should be
I'm losin' it, all I get's, jealousy, jealousy
Co-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think, I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me

Hace un tiempo no duermo con vos
Pienso cómo todo se desgastó
Te siento un poco má' rara, ya no te provoco nada
Siento más grande la cama, ¿qué es lo que pasó?
Quisiera cumplir tus expectativas
No puedo fingir lo que no soy
Sueño que algún día quiera ser mía
Pero exige todo menos amor
Juro que no quiero nada pero cuando se me acerca quiero to'
Ya no quiero lastimarme y chocar dos veces el mismo paredón
Quiero de ese veneno que me envenenó
Soy el perdedor de los dos, de los do'-oh-oh
Baby, dímelo, oh-oh, ¿qué fue que pasó, oh-oh?
Entre nosotros do'-oh-oh algo se rompió, oh-oh
No me hables de amo-o-or si mi corazó-ó-ón
Jamás te importó, no, no
Baby, dímelo, oh-oh, ¿qué fue que pasó, oh-oh?
Entre nosotros do'-oh-oh algo se rompió, oh-oh
No me hables de amo-o-or si mi corazó-ó-ón
Jamás te importó, no, no
Dije que no iba a lastimarte, lo volví a hacer
Siempre que me pongo a pensarte se larga a llover
Me cansé de escribir tu nombre en la hoja de un papel
No' queremo', pero no' hacemos mal (no' queremo', pero no' hacemos mal)
Y eso molesta
No se da cuenta que me hiere cuando la llamo y no contesta
Del amor al odio, noche' de insomnio buscando respuestas
Yo ya me sé esa jugada, no me mientas en la cara (no), no, no, no
El que las hace las paga y el karma ya tiene una deuda contigo y eso yo lo sé
Que estás cansada de verme perdido, no tiene sentido intentarlo otra vez
No me repitas algo que ya sé, incontable' las vece' que fallé
No fuiste tú, yo también te lloré pero aprendí y después te solté
Baby, dímelo, oh-oh, ¿qué fue que pasó, oh-oh?
Entre nosotros do'-oh-oh algo se rompió, oh-oh
No me hables de amo-o-or si mi corazó-ó-ón
Jamás te importó, no, no
Baby, dímelo, oh-oh, ¿qué fue que pasó, oh-oh?
Entre nosotros do'-oh-oh algo se rompió, oh-oh
No me hables de amo-o-or si mi corazó-ó-ón
Jamás te importó, no, no, no, no

Nadie lo hace como tú lo sabe' hacer (Woh-oh-oh-oh)

Las cincuenta sombra' 'e Grey y no habla' de un delincuente (Delincuente)
Ninguno gana por má' que comenten (Comenten)

Nos activamos siempre después de las doce (Tú sabe')
No es un juego, tú quieres de mi fuego (Tra, tra, tra, tra, tra)
Tómalo, bebé, yo solo quiere que tú goces
Una modelo, pero callejera (Princesa)
Dale lento, bandolera (Duro, duro)
Todas son imitación, ella es la verdadera
Cuando lo prendo, se desespera
¿Y cómo se siente, cómo se siente?
Baby, del uno al die', yo te doy un veinte
Contigo nadie gana por má' que comenten
Hoy e' noche de sexo, llamé pa' verte, eh

Nadie lo hace como tú lo sabe' hacer (Hacer)
Ese cuerpito no e' mío, pero yo le soy fiel (Soy fiel)
Si tú no quiere' salir, yo no quiero beber (Yo no quiero beber)
Pero cuando te dé hambre no' podemo' comer (Young Kingz)

De ti siempre tengo apetito
Quiero saciar tu sed, si me la como, repito
Doy lo que sea por adueñarme de ese cuerpito
Si va' pa' la calle yo le llego a cualquier sitio
Dime qué país, qué estado, qué municipio
Desde un principio
Te dije que yo me iba a envolver, ella sin filtro
Se ve mejor que mucha' editada', me anticipo
A la jugada; tiene alguien, pero soy su tipo
Y si estás sola, yo te acompaño (Yeah)
Es que de sus lágrima' yo soy el paño
Con foto' sin ropa, me dice: "Te extraño"
Yo la halaba por su pelo castaño
Y va un año que no hace na' (This is the remix)
No' devoramo' luego de salir a cenar
De amigo' del baño tiene un arsenal

Siempre con gana' 'e darte, no importa cuánto te he da'o (¿Me sigue'?)
A ti nadie te deja, tú todo' lo' ha' deja'o
En la cama, tengo gana' 'e bailarte como Rauw
Tu recuerdo me persigue (-sigue)
Pocas como tú, baby, hoy se consiguen (-siguen)
Tú te porta' mal pa' que yo te castigue
Le digo: "La presión", y me dice: "¿Me sigue'?", sí
Como Doble, dale paleta (Paleta)
Obliga'o en la uni era atleta (Obliga'o)
To' la' suela', lo' taco' son rojo' (Rojo')

This ain't build a bitch (a bitch)
You don't get to pick and choose
Different ass and bigger boobs
If my eyes are brown or blue
This ain't build a bitch (a bitch)
I'm filled with flaws and attitude
So if you need perfect, I'm not built for you (yeah)
Bob the Builder broke my heart
Told me I need fixing
Said that I'm just nuts and bolts
Lot of parts were missing
Curvy like a cursive font
Virgin and a vixen
That's the kind of girl he wants
But he forgot
This ain't build a bitch (a bitch)
You don't get to pick and choose
Different ass and bigger boobs
If my eyes are brown or blue
This ain't build a bitch (a bitch)
I'm filled with flaws and attitude
So if you need perfect, I'm not built for you (one, two, three, ooh)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
The boys are always playing dolls
Looking for their Barbie
They don't look like Ken at all
Hardly have a heartbeat
Need someone who falls apart
So he can play Prince Charming
If that's the kind of girl he wants
Then he forgot
This ain't build a bitch (a bitch)
You don't get to pick and choose
Different ass and bigger boobs
If my eyes are brown or blue
This ain't build a bitch (a bitch)
I'm filled with flaws and attitude
So if you need perfect, I'm not built for you (one, two, three)

(El Biza la soltó y sonó cabrón
La baby lo probó y se enamoró
Me llamaron pa' grabar y esta vaina se jodió
Esto no e' de la mata, el que la mata soy yo)
Todavía sigo en el juego
To' el mundo sabe como brego
20 años, seguimos invicto en esto yo soy Diego
En la copa del 86', reventando la ley
No hay defensa que pueda conmigo, baby aquí no hay break
Ellos lo saben
Que cuando me pongo pa' esto aquí no caben
Y sin montar presión, los bajo de la nave
Es muy fácil montar un número uno
Cómo yo, ninguno
La otra la dejé por picky
Ven una caravana y dicen, "mira allá va Nicky"
Las babies en Miami todas les puse su hickey, OG como Miky
Tengo una cubana y a esa yo le digo Kiki
Ella me dice: "do you love me?" (Kiki), pero cuando está horny
Pide que ese booty con el mío se lo adorne
Y una colombiana, le saqué la visa
Y se vino con una mina pa' mi socio Biza
El Biza la soltó y sonó cabrón
La baby lo probó y se enamoró
Me llamaron pa' grabar y esta vaina se jodió
Esto no e' de la mata, el que la mata soy yo
El Biza la soltó y sonó cabrón
La baby lo probó y se enamoró
Me llamaron pa' grabar y esta vaina se jodió
Esto no e' de la mata, el que la mata soy yo
N-I-C-K, Nicky Jam
I'm the king of the flow, I'm killing slowly
For you all the motherfuckers that know me
I started this game, so all you rookies pay 'cause you owe me
Or I'ma leave your face scar like Tony Montana
To's quieren dinero, to's quieren la fama
Montarse en un Bugatti, comprarse un par de cubanas
Pero no piensan en lo que vendrá mañana
Hay que capitalizar pa' que más nunca te falte la lana
El Biza la soltó y sonó cabrón
La baby lo probó y se enamoró
Me llamaron pa' grabar y esta vaina se jodió
Esto no e' de la mata, el que la mata soy yo
El Biza la soltó y sonó cabrón
La baby lo probó y se enamoró

Tú y yo, los dos juntito' frente al mar
Sé por dónde quieres ir a parar
Aunque mires así no servirá
Si es que nos entendemos sin hablar
Muero cuando te vas
Toco el cielo si estás
Sentada en mi portal
Siempre haciéndote esperar

[Estribillo: Marc Seguí]
Y ahora quiero que vuelvas como un niño los finde'
Desde que te has ido no hacen gracia los chiste'
Me he cortado el pelo, me he comprado otro tinte
Buscando a vеr si encuentro alguna como tú en Tindеr
Mi niña, eres la prota de mis canciones tristes
No pue'o cerrar los ojos mientras te me desvistes
Tú dile a las demás que no me quedan más chicles
Solo te doy a ti el amor, es así de simple

[Post-Estribillo: Marc Seguí]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Se me congela el mundo siempre que nos vemos
Discutir contigo es como un tiroteo
Y pienso en morirme el primero, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
[Verso 2: Pol Granch]
Tú y yo, los dos juntitos sin pensar
Contigo como un niño en Toys "R" Us
Que se apague la luz en Navidad
Si desprendemos electricidad
Mira, que yo lo intento, pero te desvaneces
Siempre me hago el contento, pero hoy no me apetece
Y no entienden que siempre has sido diferente
Como Venecia sin agua, como Madrid sin gente


Y ahora quiero que vuelvas como un niño los findes
Desde que te has ido no hacen gracia los chistes
Me he cortado el pelo, me he comprado otro tinte
Buscando a ver si encuentro alguna como tú en Tinder
Mi niña, eres la prota de mis canciones tristes

Siempre te vas de mí (Siempre te vas de mí)
Siempre te vas de mí (Siempre te vas de mí)
Siempre te vas de mí (De mí)
De mí (Oh-oh-oh)


Y ahora quiero que vuelvas como un niño los finde'
Desde que te has ido no hacen gracia los chistes

Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? No
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walking up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him having shit to say
You couldn't save me but you can't let me go
Oh no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know
30 Under 30 for another year
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it here
Maybe I should think about a new career
Somewhere in Kauai where I can disappear
I've been having fun, getting older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth
At least I gave him something he can cry about
I thought about my future but I want it now
Mmm, want it now
Mm-mm-mm
You can't give me up
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go
Oh no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know
Did I take it too far?
Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
Think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars
Stars
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire
Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
But the kazachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son
Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on
But when his drinking and lusting
And his hunger for power
Became known to more and more people
The demands to do something
About this outrageous man
Became louder and louder
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
"This man's just got to go", declared his enemies
But the ladies begged, "Don't you try to do it, please"
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute, they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
"Come to visit us", they kept demanding
And he really came
Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and said, "I feel fine"
Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him 'til he was dead
Oh, those Russians
I see you calling
I didn't wanna leave you like that
It's five in the morning, yeah, yeah
A hundred on the dash
'Cause my wheels are rolling
Ain't taking my foot off the gas
And it only took the one night
To see the end of the line
Staring deep in your eyes, eyes
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
I'm so good at knowing
Of when to leave the party behind
Don't care if they notice, yeah, yeah, no
I'll just catch a ride
I'd rather be lonely, yeah
Than wrapped around your body too tight
Yeah, I'm the type to get naked
Won't give my heart up for breaking
'Cause I'm too gone to be stayin', staying' (dancing on)
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Dancing on the edge, take it too far
Messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
I'm sorry, alone in the dark
I'm sorry
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Don't kill me just help me run away
From everyone I need a place to stay
Where I can cover up my face
Don't cry, I am just a freak
I am just a freak
I am just a freak
I am just a freak
My head is filled with parasites
Black holes cover up my eyes
I dream of you almost every night
Hopefully I won't wake up this time
I won't wake up this time
I won't wake up this time
I won't wake up this time

It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me
Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on
Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, ayy
Makin' beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality
Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on
Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah (ayy, ayy)
Makin' beautiful mistakes
You did me wrong 'cause I let you (let you)
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doin' somethin' different, got me lookin' stupid (damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you dreamin', lucid
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (boy, bye)
But really I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Like you don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (ah)
Yeah, bet you miss my love all in your bed (bed)
Now you're stressin' out, pullin' your hair (hair)
Smellin' your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (be friends)
You're toxic
Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah (oh)
Makin' beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, ayy (let it go)
Makin' beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah (ooh)
Nah-nah-nah

When I was a young boy living in the city
All I did was run, run, run, run, run
Staring at the lights, they look so pretty
Momma said, "Son, son, son, son, son"
"You're gonna grow up, you're gonna get old"
"All that glitters don't turn to gold"
"But until then, just have your fun"
"Boy, run, run, run, run, run"
Yeah, run, run, run
Run, run, run
When I was a young kid living in the city
All I did was pay, pay, pay, pay, pay
And every single dime that good Lord gave me
I could make it last three, four, five days
Living it up but living down low
Chasing that luck before I get old
And looking back, oh, we had some fun
Boy, run, run, run, run, run
They tell you that the sky might fall
They'll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Yeah, one day well the sky might fall
Yeah, one day I could lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
If I learned one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Run, run, run
Didn't get everything that I wanted
But I got what I need, yeah, yeah
I see that light in the morning
Shining down on me
So take me up high, take me down low
Where it all ends nobody knows
But until then let's have some fun
Yeah, run, run, run, run, run
They tell you that the sky might fall
They'll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Yeah, one day well the sky might fall
Yeah, one day I could lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
If I learned one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Run, run, run
Yeah, run, run, run
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun
Yeah, if I learned one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun, yeah, run, run, run

A rebel and I don't hide
Remember all the words that you said
Even if the love was hurtin'
I'll be yours, I'll be yours again
I can feel that fire's burnin'
Give me more
So tell me, would you feel my love?
'Cause I can never get enough
So tell me, would you feel my love?
Yeah, I could never leave, 'cause I need it, that feeling
Let me feel your love
Let me feel your love
You can make me let go
Forget about the world for a while
You had me at "Hello"
I'm drownin' in the blue of your eyes
Even if the love was hurtin'
I'll be yours, I'll be yours again
I can feel that fire's burnin'

I want it to be, like, messy
I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I, if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of 17
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth, " I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more
All I did was try my best
This the kind of thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (ah, ah, ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
(Yeah!)
I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park
All I did was try my best
This the kind of thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (ah, ah, ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
(Yeah! Just having a really good time)
Got a broken ego, broken heart
(It's brutal out here, it's brutal out here)
And God, I don't even know where to start
Yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
You could have asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
So I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time
I don't know why I run away
Oh girl, I make you cry when I run away
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (ooh, yeah)
Save your tears for another day (yeah)
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Save your tears for another day, ooh girl (ah)
I said save your tears for another day, yeah (ah)
Save your tears for another day (ah)
Save your tears for another day (ah)
Ooh
Balloons are deflatin'
Guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head
Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside
Like when you walked out my life
Why you walked out my life?
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
Do you ever think of me?
No
(Ooh) No-no, no
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Ooh, nah
I'm buildin' my hopes up
Like presents unopened 'til this day
I still see the messages you read, mmm
I'm foolishly patient
(Foolishly patient)
Can't get past the taste of your lips
(Taste of your lips)
Don't wanna let you out my head
Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside
Like when you walked out my life
Why you walked out my life?
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
Do you ever think of me?
Of me
'Cause I think of you, think of you
If you don't wanna see me
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now, 'bout me)
Oh, oh
Don't come out, out, out

If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now)
Walk away (walk away), you know how (you know how)
Don't start caring about me now (so)

But I'm ready to go buy anything that she likes
And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand in California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh
Oh, she knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love to taste, yeah
These hearts adore, everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no
'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

El baby de las babies
Ah, Maluma, baby, muah
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

Loro non sanno di che parlo
Voi siete sporchi, fra', di fango
Giallo di siga fra le dita
Io con la siga camminando
Scusami, ma ci credo tanto
Che posso fare questo salto
E anche se la strada è in salita
Per questo ora mi sto allenando
E buonasera, signore e signori, fuori gli attori
Vi conviene toccarvi i coglioni
Vi conviene stare zitti e buoni
Qui la gente è strana, tipo spacciatori
Troppe notti stavo chiuso fuori
Mo' li prendo a calci 'sti portoni
Sguardo in alto tipo scalatori
Quindi scusa mamma se sto sempre fuori, ma
Sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro
E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro
Io ho scritto pagine e pagine, ho visto sale poi lacrime
Questi uomini in macchina e non scalare le rapide
C'è scritto sopra una lapide, in casa mia non c'è Dio
Ma se trovi il senso del tempo risalirai dal tuo oblio
E non c'è vento che fermi la naturale potenza
Dal punto giusto di vista, del vento senti l'ebrezza
Con ali in cera alla schiena ricercherò quell'altezza
Se vuoi fermarmi ritenta, prova a tagliarmi la testa perché
Sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro
E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro
Parla, la gente purtroppo parla
Non sa di che cosa parla
Tu portami dove sto a galla
Che qui mi manca l'aria
Parla, la gente purtroppo parla
Non sa di che cosa parla
Tu portami dove sto a galla
Che qui mi manca l'aria
Parla, la gente purtroppo parla
Non sa di che cazzo parla
Tu portami dove sto a galla
Che qui mi manca l'aria
Ma sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro
E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro
Noi siamo diversi da loro
Quién lo diría
Que se podría hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
You know I'm just a flight away
If you wanted you can take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando
Quién lo diría
Que se podría hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind
I can read your mind
What you want to do
It's written all over your face times two
'Cause I can read your mind
I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
On repeat
Quién lo diría
Que se podría hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Botella tras botella ando tomando
Pa olvidarme de ella (pa olvidarme de ella)
De ella, de ella nomás hablo
En todas mis pedas (en todas mis pedas)
A mis compas bien hartos traigo ya (jajai)
Me dicen: "güey, ya la tienes que superar"
Pero yo no puedo (yo no puedo)
Pa ser sinceros, yo ni quiero
Mejor su recuerdo me lo bebo
Los tragos me saben mejor así
Estaba pensando en llamarte, yo te miro por todas partes
Pero ya no nos vemos, puede que lo olvidemos
Dos tragos y vuelvo a pensarte
Me aferro, no quiero olvidarte
Sentimientos ajenos, los celos no son buenos
Y si me llamas contesto, aunque nunca va a pasar eso
(Aunque nunca va a pasar eso)
Ya mejor ni te molesto, porque sé que vuelvo a joderlo
(Ahuevo que vuelvo a joderlo)
Y ahora que ando tomando bebida
Me siento triste, ya va a amanecer
A veces borracho las penan se olvidan
Pero nunca te dejé de querer
Fui mal partido, querida
Todas mis pedas marcándote al cel
Le puse sal a la herida
Cómo quisiera volver al ayer
Sentimental yo me pongo, siempre me acuerdo de ti
(Yo siempre me acuerdo de ti)
Me agarra la depre seguido y hasta te escribí un CD
(Y hasta te escribí un CD)
Botella tras botella voy a tomarme
Pa acordarme de ella (pa acordarme de ella)
De ella, de ella estoy hablando
Como siempre en mis pedas (como siempre en mis pedas)
A mis compas bien hartos traigo ya (jajai)
Me dicen: "güey, ya la tienes que superar"
Pero yo no puedo (yo no puedo)
Pa ser sinceros, yo ni quiero
Mejor su recuerdo me lo bebo
Los tragos me saben mejor así
Estaba pensando en llamarte yo
Estaba pensando en llamarte yo
Pero ya no nos vemos
Pero ya no nos vemos
Sentimental yo me pongo, siempre me acuerdo de ti
(Yo siempre me acuerdo de ti)
Me agarra la depre seguido y hasta te escribí un CD
(Y hasta te escribí un CD)
Y si amas a alguien, no la dejes ir
Para que no tengas que dedicarle una canción como esta
Paz

A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
My mind feels like a foreign land (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Silence ringing inside my head (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
How many pennies in the slot? (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Giving us up didn't take a lot (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I saw the end 'fore it begun (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Still I carried, I carried, I carried on (oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh

Loving you is a losing game
I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Six bars laid across the sky
Four empty walls to fill the time
One careless word you lose your life
A grave new world awaits inside
Lycanthropic survival instincts
Embrace the beast and shun the weak
Awake the primal one that sleeps inside
Or feel the shiv(er) running through your spine
The time is slipping by no peace in sight
But the teeth of time still hold their bite
My hands are painted red
My future's painted black
I can't recognize myself
I've become someone else
My hands are painted red
My hands are painted red
Schizophrenic amnesia
Bid goodbye to all you knew and loved
Forget the only life that you knew outside
They bought the ticket now you take the ride
The time is slipping by no peace in sight
But the teeth of time still hold their bite
My hands are painted red
My future's painted black
I can't recognize myself
I've become someone else
My hands are painted red
My hands are painted red
Another number quickly learns the rules
A hidden burner waits to point at you
A subtle gesture and you're ventilated
Talk isn't cheap here bleed out in payment
Six bars laid across the sky
Four empty walls to fill the time
My hands are painted red
My future's painted black
I can't recognize myself
I've become someone else
My hands are painted red
My hands are painted red, red, red, red
My future's painted black
I can't recognize myself
I've become someone else
My hands are painted red
My hands are painted red
Heaven sent you to me
I'm just hopin' I don't repeat history

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
Let go
I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I say so
I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (the echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me
What you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me
What are you gonna do?
It's only me
Let it go
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles

I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
But I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little, by little, by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Would we be better off by now
If I'd let my walls come down?
Maybe I guess we'll never know
You know, you know
Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby

Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

Hey, this is a story I hate
And telling it might make me break
But I'll tell it anyway
This chapter's about
How you said there was nobody else
Then you got up and went to her house
You guys always left me out
I still have the letter you wrote
When you told me that I was the only girl
You'd ever want in your life
I guess my friends were right
Each day goes by and each night, I cry
Somebody saw you with her last night
You gave me your word, "Don't worry 'bout her"
You might love her now, but you loved me first
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are
Oh, you swore on every star
How could you be so reckless with my heart?
You check in and out
Of my heart like a hotel
And she must be perfect, oh well
I hope you both go to hell
I still have the letter you wrote
When you told me that I was the only girl
You'd ever want in your life
I guess my friends were right
Each day goes by and each night, I cry
Somebody saw you with her last night
You gave me your word, "Don't worry 'bout her"
You might love her now, but you loved me first
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are (here we are)
Oh, you swore on every star
How could you be so reckless with my heart? (Heart)
How could you be so reckless?
How could you be so reckless?
How could you be so reckless with someone's heart?
Hey, this is a story I hate
But I told it to cope with the pain
I'm so sorry if you can relate
Eh-eh

Yo sé que está' loca, mai, cuando te arrimá'
Y a la vez que te como y que te veo, oh
Otra' me llaman pa'l faranduleo, oh
Mi corazón es tuyo, al igual que la calle
Si alguien te destruyó, te juro
El dinero del curro con vo' vo'a gastarme
Turra' que se callen, te juro
De mí esperan lo que nadie le da
Es del barrio como una Gilera
Anoche ví que ella subió una foto
Tenía mi remera y una visera
De mí esperan lo que nadie le da
Es del barrio como una Gilera
Anoche ví que ella subió una foto
Tenía mi remera y una visera (Ba-Bandi)
Yo te comí, baby, escuchando Romeo
Tu' amiga vienen con cuento pero yo ya no lo' leo
Están celosa' porque a toda' la' picheo
Solo contigo ready pa'l peliculeo
No pare', my baby
Voy por ti, esa hoe no comprende
De to' el hood tu toto e' el que me enciende
Tira lu', di que yo vo'a comerte
Puede que te rompa el toto, nunca el corazón
Aunque me juzguen tus amiga', no tienen razón
No me conocen, bebé, no saben na' de mí
Junan mi nombre na' má', que dejen de mentir
Más de una de ella' me llamó para el faranduleo
Dejo en espera su mensaje, ninguno los leo
Contale' que te comí toda escuchando Romeo
Y que llamaron a la poli porque tenían miedo
Y ni siquiera le repito que la amo
Miti-miti, fifty-fifty, vamo' y vamo'
Sabe que la quiero, cora de gitano
Do' beso' en la mejilla y el otro en la mano (Prr)
Me pidió flore', le di un frasco en ve' de un ramo
Me dio su cora pa' que me aleje 'e lo' gramo'
Nos peleamo' par de vece', no' celamo'
Pero después en secreto no' arreglamo'
A veces te quiero presente en mi vida
Otra' vece' me amargo, lo gasto en bebida
Pero creo que estás hecha a mi medida
Con tu bolso Nike, con tu combi de Adida'
A veces te quiero presente en mi vida
Otra' vece' me amargo, lo gasto en bebida
Pero creo que estás hecha a mi medida
Con tu bolso Nike, con tu combi de Adida'
Esto es un palo pa' la historia, yeah
Esto es un palo pa' la historia, yeah

Esto es un palo pa' la historia, yeah
Bandido, Tiago
Dímelo, Rei
Lean in the mix
Duko, you know
Yeah, damn, yeah
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
First things first
Can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start with from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without hurt
Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without game
I know that glory don't come without...
Don't come without...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of fire and flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought: "Wow, if I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out"
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair
But I thought: "How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?"
If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own, cutting class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were living in
If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are, show them we are
Let's show them we are, show them we are
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are, show them we are
Let's show them we are, show them we are
Let's show them we are better
If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris (if we go down)
We were staying in Paris (if we go down)
We were staying in Paris (if we go down)
We were staying in Paris (if we go down)
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
If we go down
Let's show them we are better
If we go down
Let's show them we are better
If we go down
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (found)
But you never go away (never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Walkin' out of town
Lookin' for a better place (lookin' for a better place)
Something's on my mind (mind)
Always in my head space
But I know some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Whoa, yeah
Yeah, ah
Whoa, whoa
Hello, welcome home
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh)
Ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Needless to say, I keep her in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (yeah)
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (wreck)
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (wreck)
Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check
She was all bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise
And I'm not tryna lose
Then you're left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower
Every time I'm leavin' on you (ooh)
You don't make it easy, no (no, no)
Wish I could be there for you
Give me a reason to, oh (oh)
Every time I'm walkin' out
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (now)
I know you're scared of the unknown ('known)
You don't wanna be alone (alone)
I know I always come and go (and go)
But it's out of my control
And you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower (yeah)
I could say I never dare
To think about you in that way, but
I would be lyin'
And I pretend I'm happy for you
When you find some dude to take home
But I won't deny that
In the midst of the crowds
In the shapes in the clouds
I don't see nobody but you
In my rose-tinted dreams
Wrinkled silk on my sheets
I don't see nobody but you
Boy, you got me hooked onto something
Who could say that they saw us coming?
Tell me
Do you feel the love?
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me
Let me take you to the place of your dreams
Tell me
Do you feel the love?
And I could say I never unzipped
Those blue Levi's inside my head
But that's far from the truth
Don't know what's come over me
It seems like yesterday when I said
"We'll be friends forever"
Constellations of stars
Murals on city walls
I don't see nobody but you
You're my vice, you're my muse
You're a nineteenth floor view
I don't see nobody but you
Boy, you got me hooked onto something
Who could say that they saw us coming?
Tell me
Do you feel the love?
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me
Let me take you to the place of your dreams
Tell me
Do you feel the love?
Boy, you got me hooked onto something
Who could say that they saw us coming?
Tell me
Do you feel the love?
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me
Let me take you to the place of your dreams
Tell me
Do you feel the love?
Do you feel the love?
Do you feel the love?
Do you feel the love?
Do you feel the love?
Feel the love
Do you feel the love?
I've been goin' through some things (oh)
I struggle with my inner man (yeah, yeah)
I hustle, I'll do what I can to get this money
Blaq Tuxedo
Don Dada on the, Don Dada on the beat
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through (yeah)
Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's motherfuckin' scary
Tryna keep him 'cause I found him
Let a hoe know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight
Like the birds of a feather, baby
We real life made for each other
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
You think I'd leave your side, baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down
When you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you want
And if only you could see into me

Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me

When you're on the outside, baby
And you can't get in
I will show you
You're so much better than you know
When you're lost and you're alone
And you can't get back again
I will find you
Darling, and I will bring you home
And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time, you'll be fine
[Verse 3]
You think I'd leave your side, baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down
When you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you're wrong
And if only you could see into me

Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh, when you're low
I'll be there
By your side, baby
Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh, when you're low
I'll be there
By your side, baby
Ela riu do meu cabelo sem me conhecer
E eu que sou um cara esperto já colei pra ver
Qual que era da morena
Com sorriso lindo do olho azul
Começamos, papo louco sem me perceber
Sobre ex, talvez seja melhor nem dizer
Eu vim lá da Zona Oeste, ela é menina da Zona Sul
Menina mulher, que intimida atitude
De quem sabe o que quer, mesmo que o tempo mude
Ela é sol, é verão, é poema, é canção
Que alegra o meu coração
Morena, me encantei com o seu jeito de olhar
Paralisei o tempo só pra lembrar
Daquela cena que eu tirava a tua saia
E você beijava a minha boca
Me encantei com o seu jeito de olhar
Paralisei o tempo só pra lembrar
Daquela cena que eu tirava a tua saia
E você beijava a minha boca
Dali pra frente a história começou a complicar
Ela foi pro Rio embora e levou o meu colar
Até me mandou uma foto
Jurando que não foi por querer
Eu fingindo acreditar que tava tudo bem
Sei que quando olhar pra ele
Vai me desejar como ninguém
Morena malandra, você não me engana
Eu sei que foi por querer
E mesmo que for, isso é bom pra lembrar
Desse nosso romance, quando o peito apertar
Você pensa em mim, tô pensando em você
Tá difícil de te esquecer
Morena, me encantei com o seu jeito de olhar
Paralisei o tempo só pra lembrar
Daquela cena que eu tirava a tua saia
E você beijava a minha boca
Me encantei com o seu jeito de olhar
Paralisei o tempo só pra lembrar
Daquela cena que eu tirava a tua saia
E você beijava a minha boca
Morena
Morena
Ela riu do meu cabelo sem me conhecer
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
It felt like ooh, la-la-la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh, la-la-la, yeah
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall, oh
Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la (true, la-la)
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
All along I've been coming for ya (for ya)
And I hope it meant something to ya (ooh)
Call my name, I'll be coming for ya
Coming for ya, coming for ya, coming for ya
For ya
For ya (oh, she loves it when I call)
For ya
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Loving and fighting, accusing, denying
I can't imagine a world with you gone
The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of
I'd be so lost if you left me alone
You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming? Please don't leave me
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you
Long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming? Please don't leave me
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you
I don't wanna let go
I know I'm not that strong
I just wanna hear you
Saying, "Baby, let's go home"
Let's go home
Yeah, I just wanna take you home
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight
Esto es Mya, Mya
El tiempo no volvió a tener segundos otra vez
Se mide al ritmo en el que estás bailando
Yo te tengo en la mira desde que llegue
Me tiembla el pulso si estoy apuntando
Al ver tu tatuaje perdí mi coraje
Que un trago me relaje que te quiero hablar
Y si logro que el cielo te acerque y bailemos
Yo voy a rogar
Que suene una canción más lenta
Que dure un poco más de la cuenta
Quiero disimular que no me sé tu nombre
Yo quiero conocerte como corresponde
Que suene una canción más lenta
Que dure más de dos con cincuenta
Con un poco de tiempo hare que todo encaje
Como lo hace tu falda con tu maquillaje (Mya)
Me estoy muriendo pa' que sean las doce
Y que tu boca roce con mi boca y no sé tú
Pero yo quiero esta noche con voce
Caipiriña y goce
Porque mi niña yo que suerte tuve
De haberte conocido la noche perfecta
Salieron las estrellas pero no las nubes
Y tu pudiste ver todas mis indirectas
Ay que suerte tuve
Que suene una canción más lenta
Que dure un poco más de la cuenta
Quiero disimular que no me sé tu nombre
Yo quiero conocerte como corresponde
Que suene una canción más lenta
Que dure más de dos con cincuenta
Con un poco de tiempo hare que todo encaje
Como lo hace tu falda con tu maquillaje
Así cerquita y agarrao' a tu cinturita
Loco por esa boquita que aun no puedo besar
Mami paremo' el tiempo
Disfrutemo' el momento
Que otra como tú sé que no voy a encontrar
Bailemos esta canción
Quiero verte en slow
Te acercaste un poquito y me subió la presión
Vamo' entrando en calor
Ya va saliendo el sol
Sé que estamos sintiendo lo mismo los dos
Que suene una canción más lenta (que suene, no, no, no)
Y dure un poco más de la cuenta
Quiero disimular que no me sé tu nombre
Yo quiero conocerte como corresponde
Que suene una canción más lenta
Que dure más de dos con cincuenta
Con un poco de tiempo hare que todo encaje
Como lo hace tu falda con tu maquillaje, yeah
Mo-Mo-Mo-Mosty
Que suene una canción más lenta
Mya
Jaja
Yeah
Yo sé que esto no volverá a pasar
Pero si volviera a pasar
Sé que sería tu debilidad
Porque la noche de anoche fue (-ue)
Algo que yo no puedo explicar
Sola, dando y dándole sin parar (-rar)
Tú me decías que morías por mí
Porque la noche de anoche fue (eh eh)
Algo que yo no puedo explicar (eh eh)
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar
Tú encima de mí, yo encima de ti (oh oh)
Eh, eh
Tú me dejaste el cuerpo caliente, infierno
Pero me dejaste el corazón frío, invierno
Soñando que contigo es que duermo (duermo)
Dime, papi
Dime, mami
¿Esa noche quién la borra?
Tú me besaste y se me cayó la gorra
Sin mucha labia, sin mucha cotorra
Cuando estoy contigo dejo que la vibra corra
Y que la luna nos supervise
Con esa boquita suena rico todo lo que tú me dices
Hicimos poses que yo más nunca hice
Tú te mojaste pa que yo me bautice
Y me ponga serio, serio
Tú y yo juntos creando un imperio
Esos ojitos tienen un misterio
Pero al final nada de lo nuestro fue en serio
Y ya me ha pasao que me han ilusionao
Y ya me ha pasao que me han abandonao
Y ya me ha pasao que no estás a mi lao
Y ya me ha pasao
Porque la noche de anoche fue (eh eh)
Algo que yo no puedo explicar (eh eh)
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar (eh eh)
Tú encima de mí, yo encima de ti (oh oh)
Porque la noche de anoche fue (eh eh)
Algo que yo no puedo explicar (eh eh)
Sola, dando y dándole sin parar (eh eh)
Yo encima de ti, tú encima de mí (oh oh)
Que yo me iría otra vez pa Japón (hey)
Papi, qué penita tú, qué maldición (mmm)
La paleta es dulce, azúcar de algodón (yeh)
Y es la única que me llega hasta al corazón
Yo no me olvido, la suerte está echada (bum)
Se me enredaba el pelo en la pantalla
Sabes que solo lo hago de leyenda (¡wuh!)
Lo subo al cielo, yo soy su messiah
El benito es un diablillo, ella es un ángel
Lo tengo juqueao como si fuera tote
Baby, entre nosotros nunca competimos
Si preguntan dice, "ella todos los récords bate"
Y ya me ha pasao que me han ilusionao
Y ya me ha pasao que me han abandonao
Y ya me ha pasao que no estás a mi lao
Y ya me ha pasao
Porque la noche de anoche fue (eh eh)
Algo que yo no puedo explicar (eh eh)
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar (eh eh)
Tú encima de mí, yo encima de ti (oh oh)
Porque la noche de anoche fue (eh eh)
Algo que yo no puedo explicar (eh eh)
Eso era dando, dándole sin parar (eh eh)
Tú encima de mí, yo encima de ti (oh oh)
Mmm jum
Mmm
Mmm, jum
Woo, woo
I pull up like
How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
How you pull up? I pull up (Woo, SethInTheKitchen)


Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, "You play, you lay," don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: DaBaby & Roddy Ricch]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo, yeah)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop (Yeah, yeah)


Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote
[Chorus: DaBaby]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop
I still remember the third of December, me in your sweater
You said it looked better on me than it did you
Only if you knew how much I liked you
But I watch your eyes as she
Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than the blue sky
She's got you mesmerised while I die
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better
Wish I were Heather
Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her, she's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she
Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than the blue sky
She's got you mesmerised while I die
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better
I wish I were Heather
Oh, I wish I were Heather
Oh, oh, wish I were Heather
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better
Wish I were-
Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you should've told me that you were thinkin' 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple months, so you're calling me now
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason
Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason
Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
What did you think would happen?
What did you think would happen?
I'll never let you have it
What did you think would happen?
Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
(You broke me first)
You broke me first, oh
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade
One day my father, he told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say
"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"
He said: "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars
He said: "Go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home, no matter where you are"
One day my father, he told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
When I was just a kid, I heard him say
"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"
He said: "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
My father told me
I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ahh-ah-ah
And they come unstuck
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ahh-oh
And they come unstuck
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
Yeah, I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
Yeah, hey
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
Yeah, hey
And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, was hard to find
Oh well, whatever, never mind
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial, a denial
A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial
I wore makeup when we dated
'Cause I thought you'd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you liked
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type
And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favorite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books
So you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave
You found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
And all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
And maybe I'm just not as interesting
As the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less
About someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back
Before you found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
Don't you think I loved you too much to be used and discarded?
Don't you think I loved you too much to think I deserve nothing?
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy
Feel sorry for yourself
'Cause someday I'll be everything to somebody else
And they'll think that I am so exciting
And you'll be the one who's crying
Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
You say I'm never satisfied
But that's not me, it's you
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I don't think anything could ever be enough
For you, enough for you, oh-oh
No, nothing's enough for you
Take you like a drug
I taste you on my tongue
You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I love that she's got daddy issues, and I do too
I tried to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shade
Always comes at the worst time
You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I love that she's got daddy issues
I keep on trying to let you go
I'm dying to let you know
How I'm getting on
I didn't cry when you left at first
But now that you're dead it hurts
This time I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared
Go ahead and cry, little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
You gotta let it out soon, just let it out
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I love that she's got daddy issues, and I do too
If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I love that she's got daddy issues, and I do too

And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken, one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song, that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
Oh oh
I wanna sing a song, that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up oh oh, oh
I remember the day
Even wrote down the date, that I fell for you (mmhm)
And now it's crossed out in red
But I still can't forget if I wanted too
And it drives me insane
Think I'm hearing your name, everywhere I go
But it's all in my head
It's just all in my head
But you won't see me break, call you up in three days
Or send you a bouquet, saying, "It's a mistake"
Drink my troubles away, one more glass of champagne
And you know
I'm the first to say that I'm not perfect
And you're the first to say you want the best thing
But now I know a perfect way to let you go
Give my last hello, hope it's worth it
Here's your perfect
My best was just fine
How I tried, how I tried to be great for you
I'm flawed by design and you love to remind me
No matter what I do
But you won't see me break, call you up in three days
Or send you a bouquet, saying, "It's a mistake"
Drink my troubles away, one more glass of champagne
And you know
I'm the first to say that I'm not perfect
And you're the first to say you want the best thing
But now I know a perfect way to let you go
Give my last hello, hope it's worth it
I'm the first to say that I'm not perfect
And you're the first to say you want the best thing (best thing, yeah)
But now I know a perfect way to let you go
Give my last hello, hope it's worth it
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
But now I know a perfect way to let you go
Give my last hello, hope it's worth it
Here's your perfect
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the Heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
"We were born sick", you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
A-, Amen, Amen, Amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Oh, oh, Amen, Amen, Amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
I've been holding onto pieces, swimming in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you
'Cause I'm needing a little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love
Lately I've been counting stars
And I'm sorry that I broke your heart
It's something that I didn't want for you
But I'm stepping on broken glass
And I know this is my final chance
All I'm tryna do is find my path to you
I've got voices in my head and there's a deafening silence
I've got voices in my head and I can't lie
I've been holding onto pieces, swimming in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you
'Cause I'm needing a little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathing
These awful wounds ain't healing
Tryna find my way back to you
'Cause I'm needing a little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love
A little bit of love
Lately I've been wakin' up
In that dream you stay calling your name
Stayed up too late just thinking of you
Now I'm knocking on every door
'Cause I heard you moved from twenty-two
Has it been that long?
I guess time just flew
I've got voices in my head and there's a deafening silence
I've got voices in my head and I can't lie
I've been holding onto pieces, swimming in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you
'Cause I've needed a little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathing
These awful wounds ain't healing
Tryna find my way back to you
'Cause I'm needing a little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love
A little bit of love
I tried to fly but I used my wings too soon
Now everything got me thinking of you
I tried a million times to cut you loose
I've been holding onto pieces, swimming in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you
'Cause I've needed a little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathing
These awful wounds ain't healing
Tryna find my way back to you
'Cause I'm needing a little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love
A little bit of love

Suas palavras não me cortam mas me ferem

Bebé, yo te conozco tan bien, sé que fue pa' darme celos
No te diré quién, pero llorando por mí te vieron
Por mí te vieron
Déjame decirte
Se ve que él te trata bien, que es todo un caballero
Pero eso no cambiará que yo llegué primero
Sé que te va ir bien pero no te quiere como yo te quiero
Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawái de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones
Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas
Pa' que yo vea cómo te va, pa' que yo vea

Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas
Pa' que yo vea como te va de bien, pero te haces mal
Porque el amor no se compra na'
Miéntele a todos tus seguidore'
Dile que los tiempo' de ahora son mejore'
No creo que cuando te llame me ignores
Si después de mí ya no habrán más amores
Tú y yo fuimo' uno
Lo hacíamo' en ayuna' antes del desayuno
Fumábamo' la hookah y te pasaba el humo
Y ahora en esta guerra no gana ninguno
Si me preguntas, nadie tiene culpa
A vece' los problemas a uno se le juntan
Déjame hablar, porfa, no me interrumpas
Si te hice algo malo, entonces discúlpame
La gente te lo va a creer, actúas bien ese papel
Baby, pero no eres feliz con él
Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawái de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones
Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas
Pa' que yo vea cómo te va, pa' que yo vea
Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'

You found your way but it's never enough
And though it's been tough for you
Losing touch, but ah
Summer has its end sometimes
And although I can't promise you much
You'll be fine
You'll be fine
Saw you make your bed up
Somewhere in the darkness
It's hittin' you the hardest
Oh, no one predicted how far we came
It's not what you wanted
How fast the time goes
Living in the moment
Taking you for granted
It's a new normal
It's up to us to live in it
Not to understand it
You found your way but it's never enough
And though it's been tough for you
Losing touch, but ah
Summer has its end sometimes (yeah)
Although I can't promise you much
You'll be fine
You'll be fine
You don't pick your pages
That's how the story goes
And this life is what you make it
It's out of your control
It's almost like you're screaming
But no one hears your voice
'Cause everything is changing (oh)
You found your way but it's never enough
'Cause everything is changing (changing)
And I can't stop a thing
You found your way but it's never enough
'Cause everything is changing (yeah)
It's just a season
It's just a season
It's just a season
Just a (take me back to the start)
It's just a season
It's just a season
It's just a season
Just a
Found your way, it's never enough
And though it's been tough for you
Losing touch, oh, ah
Summer has its end sometimes
Sometimes
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landside,
No escape from reality
Open your eyes,
Look up to the skies and see,
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
Little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
Me, to me
Mamaaa,
Just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
Now he's dead
Mamaaa, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, oooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
The time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, oooh
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo
I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
(Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
For meee
So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows...
Ella e' buena, pero le gustan lo' malo'
Si te soy sincero, yo por ella jalo
Me tiró diciéndome que la dejaron
Es otra más que con su corazón jugaron, ey
¿Ese bandido qué le hizo?, dígame por qué llora
Confiéseme pa' darle piso y enterrarlo ahora
Que yo la puedo defender a usted si me colabora
Le voy a dejar saber a ese man que ya no está sola (wuh)
¿Ese bandido qué le hizo?, dígame por qué llora (dígame por qué llora)
Confiéseme pa' darle piso y enterrarlo ahora
Que yo la puedo defender a usted si me colabora
Le voy a dejar saber a ese man que ya no está sola (wuh)
Mi amor, avísame si acaso te incomoda
Pa' reventarlo y que sepa que no estás sola
Yo te hablo claro, yo no brego con pistola'
Pero tengo el respeto de lo' que controlan
Tú ere' hermosa, mami, dime por qué llora'
Te haría mi señora
Ella le da lo mismo en un crucero que una yola
Condone' de colore', la parto a lo crayola
Mujere' como tú uno las desea y las añora (añora)
Dile que tú tiene' vaqueo
Si pone' el booty en reversa
Yo le prendo la cámara como cuando parqueo
Le gusta el maleanteo
Dice que la están buscando porque mata la liga, yo se lo creo
¿Ese bandido qué le hizo?
Dígame por qué llora (baby, ¿por qué llora?, ey)
Confiéseme pa' darle piso y enterrarlo ahora (pa' meterle ahora, ja, ja)
Que yo la puedo defender a usted si me colabora (si me colabora)
Le voy a dejar saber a ese man que ya no está sola (me dicen Juhn "El All Star", baby)
¿Y ese bandido qué fue lo que hizo? (oh-oh)
Confiesa pa' de una darle piso (piso)
Ya no te quiero ver llorando, ese no vuelve hacerte daño
Bebecita, te lo garantizo (wuh)
Es que lo de ella y lo mío e' un romance secreto
Calla'o, bien en discreto, la beso y la aprieto
Me la llevo por el mundo y gasto el ticket completo
Por ella reviento a cualquier sujeto
A ella le gusta lo malo, lo bueno, lo caro
Titerona, no se asusta si escucha un disparo
El cuerpo e' hermoso, los ojos son claro'
Era mi reina, ahora e' mi diosa, a ella ni la comparo
Qué pereza
Verla triste con tanta belleza
¿Quién dañó un corazón con mucha pureza?
No sabe tratar con delicadeza
Princesa, a él no le interesa
Si yo soy el que te toca y te besa
Cuando la vi yo dije: "Quiero con esa"
Desde esa vez no sales de mi cabeza
¿Ese bandido qué le hizo?
Dígame por qué llora (baby, ¿por qué llora?, ey)
Confiéseme pa' darle piso y enterrarlo ahora (pa' meterle ahora, ja, ja)
Que yo la puedo defender a usted si me colabora (si me colabora)
Le voy a dejar saber a ese man que ya no está sola
¿Ese bandido qué le hizo? (ay)
¿Qué le hizo? (me dicen Juhn "El All Star" baby)
Este e' Juhn

La Casa Blanca en sociedad con los de Oro
One World
When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
Dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly
Dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Sing, la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, "oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know the sun must set to rise"
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh, oh
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
This could be para, be paradise
Para-paradise
Para-paradise
This could be para, be paradise
Para-paradise
Para-paradise

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars
I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

I feel your love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called Yellow
So, then I took my turn
What a thing to've done
And it was all yellow
Your skin
Oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn in to something beautiful
Do you know
You know I love you so
You know I love you so
I swam across
I jumped across for you
What a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
What a thing to do
And it was all yellow
And your skin
Oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn in to something beautiful
Do you know
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
It's true
Look how they shine for you

Look at the stars

Vive dedicándome los estribillos (you know)
Ba-ba-baby, me cansé de poner pero' (poner pero')
'Toy como para gritarlo al mundo, que te quiero (que te quiero)

Si ello' no valen nada
Lo hacemo', son cincuenta sombra' 'e grey
Nos maquillamo', no no' ve la ley

Alguém me fez, vou desacreditar que existe amor
No meu coração, pisou, pisou
E é por isso que eu tô assim
Sem enxergar o sentimento que cê tá sentindo
Pra você é amor, pra mim é risco
Eu não tô pronto pra me arriscar
Uh, mesmo que prometa me amar
Mesmo que prometa me cuidar
A minha mente acha que só quer me usar
Eu não tô duvidando de você
Mas, se for amor, vai entender
E se for pra dar certo, o tempo vai dizer
Ô, se aí existe amor
Se for amor
Você vai esperar
O meu coração curar
Ô, se aí existe amor
Se for amor
Você vai esperar
O meu coração curar pra te amar
Ô veneno, meu irmão
La-laiá-laiá
Alguém me fez desacreditar que existe amor

Tamo junto e misturado meu amigo Vitor Fernandes
Obrigado por participar, meu irmão
Tamo junto, meu vaqueiro João Gomes
Que Deus abençoe
Chama no piseiro
Alguém me fez
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is a prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know

And she make me breakfast almost every morning (every morning)
And she take a naked pic' before she leave the door
I be waking up to pics' before a nigga yawning
And every weekend my shawty comin' over (over)

She ain't driving no Camry, she pullin' in a Rover (Rover)
With her hair so curly, I love you, baby

It's just you and me
You know what I be on, I'm about to go raw (love you, baby)
'Cause I like what I see
Look, baby, I said I ain't gon' front
You got my heart beating so fast to words I can't pronounce
And I be getting the chills every time I feel your touch
I be looking at the top and girl, it's only us
All I need is your trust
And girl I told you once, don't make me tell you twice
I know you see this print through my pants that I know you like
And yo' ass be looking so fat when it be in them tights
And I'm going straight to the top, so hope you ain't afraid of heights
You always treat me right, for a fact, you never left
Through all the trials and tribulations, always had my best
So here's 55 hunnid, go and get your breasts
Start rubbin' on your butt, start kissing on yo' neck
Hey batter, batter, hey batter, batter
Niggas know I had to swing, I had to make a play
I had to apply the pressure, 'cause you my hidden treasure
I think I'm falling in love
She said, "What you know 'bout love?" (I'll tell you everything)
I got what you need (oh)
Walk up in the store and get what you want (go get it)
You get what you please
We 'bout to get it on, take off them drawers (I said I love you, baby)
It's just you and me
You know what I be on, I'm about to go raw (love you, baby)
'Cause I like what I see (oh)
I was listenin' to the ocean
I saw a face in the sand
But when I picked it up
Then it vanished away from my hands, down
I had a dream I was seven
Climbing my way in a tree
I saw a piece of heaven
Waiting impatient for me, down
And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows
Nobody knows, and
I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
I was painting a picture
The picture was a painting of you and
For a moment I thought you were here
But then again, it wasn't true, down
And all this time I have been lyin'
Oh, lyin' in secret to myself
I've been putting sorrow on the
Farthest place on my shelf
La-di-da
And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows
Nobody knows, and
I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
But I kept runnin'
For a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin'
For a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin'
For a soft place to fall
And I kept runnin'
For a soft place to fall
And I was runnin' far away
Would I run off the world someday?
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Home where I belong
Oh, no, no
Now take me home
Home where I belong
Ho, ho, ho
Now take me home
Home where I belong
Oh, no, no
Now take me home
Home where I belong
I can't take it anymore

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room

Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Did this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?)
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you

Used to be my homie, you ain't gang no more (no)
I am not a nigga you could claim you no more (no)
Traumatized, hoping it don't rain no more
You done put me through some things that done changed my aura
Now all around the world, I explore, no Dora
New bitch, I might drip out and Dior her
Ass fat, shawty straight heat, no Florida
Bad and she know it, for herself, I applaud her
No needs, yeah, I'm talkin' my boo
So please, leave 'lone, I'm through
And it's all 'cause of what you started
I been told you I won't lose (mmh)
Steady callin' my phone (brrt)

Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss; how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss; it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed, and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his


Chest now, he takes off her
Dress now, let me go
And I just can't look; it's killing me
They're taking control


Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

With every step you take?


Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby, please


Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Oh, what you lost
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
You will know
Oh, you'll know
I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now
Oh, and you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most
I'm gonna love you 'til
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me 'til we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go

Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

[Verse 1: Powfu]
Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending


Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Yeah, ayy)
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Ayy, yeah)

I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me


Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed


Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing, I was just thinking how we don't have a song"
And he says
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date; "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said "Amen"
Asking God if he could play it again
I was walkin' up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date; "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said "Amen"
Asking God if he could play it again
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date; "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
Play it again
Oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song
Let's go
Steve walks warily down the street
With his brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready hey are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat look out
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Hey
Oh take it - Bite the dust bite the dust
Hey Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust ow
Another one bites the dust he he
Another one bites the dust haaaa
Ooh shoot out
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down
But I'm ready yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust yeah
Hey I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Shoot out
Baby, I like your style
Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
Baby, I like your style
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishin' for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time
And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand

And we've drunk a couple bottles, babe
And set our grief aside
The papers say it's doomsday
The button has been pressed
We're gonna nuke each other up boys
'Til old Satan stands impressed
And here it is, our final night alive
And as the earth runs to the ground
Oh girl, it's you that I lie with
As the atom bomb locks in
Oh, it's you I watch TV with
As the world, as the world caves in
You put your final suit on

Oh, we're going out in style, babe
And everything's on sale
We creep up on extinction
I pull your arms right in
I weep and say goodnight, love
While my organs pack it in
And here it is, our final night alive
And as the earth runs to the ground
Oh girl, it's you that I lie with
As the atom bomb locks in
Oh, it's you I watch TV with

(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
I think about you on the road when I tear down the booth
Girl, I can't wait 'til I get home and fuck the shit out of you
Even on your worst days, girl, you still kind of cute
If it go down, I'm gonna protect you, pull that stick out and shoot
All I want is your love, I can't see no bitch after you
Off emotions, we did things that we didn't have to do
Scared of you leaving, I told lies when you asked for the truth
I second guessed if you the one, that's when I didn't' have a clue
And we Martin and Gina, but we ain't think about behind the scenes
The way I kill it, lose her voice when she tryin' to scream
We from the trenches, we moved onto the finer things
Now you done went from H&M to a designer fiend
He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing, you can only get this feeling from a thug
You can only get this feeling from a thug
Tears falling, and it's liquor in your cup, all you really want is love
Baby, all you really want is love
Only talk to bosses, independent, can't be fucking with a scrub
Girl, I know you can't be fucking with a scrub
I get this feeling in my stomach when you next to me
Man, I'm tryna get to know you sexually
Take you on shopping sprees for therapy
Move you out to Cali', in my mansion takin' care of me
I know sometime I'm crazy, I was hoping that you could bear with me
Beauty and the beast, pretty girl with a gangster
I swear, you still the baddest in the room with no makeup
You the type of woman every hood nigga pray for
I vow to stay a hunnid, never change up
In that sun dress, damn your body so amazing
Love the way you smell, I'm addicted to your fragrance
It's somethin' about you, but I really can't explain it
Just know that you mine, I tell that nigga he can save it
He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing, you can only get this feeling from a thug
You can only get this feeling from a thug
Tears falling, and it's liquor in your cup, all you really want is love
Baby, all you really want is love
Only talk to bosses, independent, can't be fucking with a scrub
Girl, I know you can't be fucking with a scrub

All in my comments and screamin' my name
While I'm in the club, throwin' them 100s, and 50s, and ones, and ones
Pop Smoke, they know I'm wildin'
If I'm on the island, I'm snatchin' the cell
Brody got locked, denied his bail
Until he free, I'm raisin' hell
Tell my shooters call me FaceTime

Pra te ver sentando, pra te ver jogando
Senta gostosin' que eu perco a pose de malandro
Vem jogando, jogando, jogando
(Vem jogando, jogando, jogando)
Loucuras que ela fez comigo, desceu pra bandido
Sem medo de se apaixonar
Na cama, meu vulgo ela chama, te conheço, piranha
Você não nasceu pra namorar
Loucuras que ela fez comigo, desceu pra bandido
Sem medo de se apaixonar
Na cama, meu vulgo ela chama, te conheço, piranha
Você não nasceu pra namorar
Skol Beats GT, dedadinha no MD, o clima tá têga
Ô, moça, joga essa bunda pros faixa preta
Deixa ela jogar o cu que ela não é piranha, ela é solteira
Beber, bebe, fica têga, joga esse popô pro ar
Fode gostosin' demais, mas não serve pra namorar
Fode gostosin' demais, mas não serve pra namorar
Ela é atrevida, gosta dos cara corre
Vou aplicar bebida, aplico o chá, depois o golpe
Vou aplicar bebida, aplico o chá, depois o golpe
Fetiche dela: eu de Glcok e de Lacoste
Loucuras que ela fez comigo, desceu pra bandido
Sem medo de se apaixonar
Na cama, meu vulgo ela chama, te conheço, piranha
Você não nasceu pra namorar
Loucuras que ela fez comigo, desceu pra bandido
Sem medo de se apaixonar
Na cama, meu vulgo ela chama, te conheço, piranha
Você não nasceu pra namorar
Você não nasceu pra namorar, uh uh
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Call me what you wanna, I'll be what you wanna
I've been here a thousand times, eh-eh
Fallin' for another, I don't even bother
I could do it all my life
So tell me if you wanna 'cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it 'cause I can't believe it
With every touch of you, it's like I've started dreaming
Guess Heaven's not that far away
And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
I'm just right here dancing around to the rhythm
The rhythm that you play when you're breaking my heart
You know that I can't get you out of my system
Yeah, right from the start, you played with my heart
And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
You can do whatever, I'll be here forever
Spinning 'round inside this room, eh-eh
Won't you come on over? I'm a sucker for ya
Wishing we'll be out here soon
So tell me if you wanna 'cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it 'cause I can't believe it
With every touch of you, it's like I've started dreaming
Guess Heaven's not that far away
And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
I'm just right here dancing around to the rhythm
The rhythm that you play when you're breaking my heart
You know that I can't get you out of my system
Yeah, right from the start, you played with my heart
And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
Sabia que a queda era grande
Mas tive que pular
Queria que a gente fosse mais alto
Quando segurei sua mão você soltou a minha
E ainda me empurrou do penhasco
E te dizer te amo agora é mais estranho
Estranho mesmo é te ver distante
Botar o nosso amor numa estante
Eu tive que desaprender a gostar tanto de você
Porque 'cê faz assim?
Não fala assim de mim
E eu sei que chora
Não finge que não viveu toda nossa história
Meu Deus eu pedi tanto pra não ir embora
Mas tenho que seguir meu caminho agora
E eu sei que chora
Não finge que não viveu toda nossa história
Meu Deus eu pedi tanto pra não ir embora
Mas tenho que seguir meu caminho agora
'Cê sabe bem quem eu sou
Sabe que se chamar eu vou
'Cê sabe bem quem eu sou
Sabe que se me chamar eu vou
E eu não sinto raiva, eu não sinto nada além
Do que você já sabe
Pior que 'cê sabe bem, meu bem
O tanto que eu tentei
que eu não sinto raiva, eu não sinto nada além
Do que você já sabe
Pior que 'cê sabe bem, meu bem
O tanto que eu tentei
Eu tive que desaprender a gostar tanto de você
Porque 'cê faz assim?
Não fala assim de mim
E eu sei que chora
Mas tenho que seguir o meu caminho agora
E eu sei que chora
Não finge que não viveu toda a nossa história
Meu Deus eu pedi tanto pra não ir embora
Mas tenho que seguir meu caminho agora
'Cê sabe bem quem eu sou
Sabe que se chamar eu vou
'Cê sabe bem quem eu sou
Sabe que se me chamar eu vou
Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin', late at night
Catch me drivin' down 405
Catch me and your girl late at night
Side to side
(Mustard on the beat, ho)
Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night
Long as you come through
I'ma make you come over and over
I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to
You better never make no time for these niggas
'Cause when I ride, I'ma ride, ride with you
I can't fuck with nobody
I can't keep livin' like this, I can't
I tell her what it is and I tell her what it ain't
She know that I been all in her walls like I paint
Told her at times I wanna give you trust but I can't
Bitch, I really got it out the mud, climbin' up the ranks
When they see me outside, I'm a high roller
I been on a global jet, but nigga, I fly solo
And I got the Gucci splattered all on her knick knacks
Fifty racks, I'm 'bout to break her off like a Kit-Kat
And her purse got F's like the wheels on the 'Bach
I just fucked off a million but I still got a sack
Shorty know that I'm the realest, she know I be speakin' facts
She know that I'm the same nigga that was pushin' 'Cat
She know I got the game but I'm never gon' give it back
Every time that we fuck, I gotta run it back
Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night
Long as you come through
I'ma make you come over and over
I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to
You better never make no time for these niggas
'Cause when I ride, I'ma ride, ride with you
I told shorty, never get too comfortable
I like to feel like the pussy untouchable
I like to feel like it's never goin' one way
I like to see your body drippin' Elliante
I say I like the way I took you on a wave
I had you screamin' my name out
Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night
Long as you come through
I'ma make you come over and over
I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to
You better never make no time for these niggas
'Cause when I ride, I'ma ride, ride with you
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Just had to kick a chick out of the studio, shit's nuts, fam
(Hahahaha)
I like Kyle's words, fam, the truth is madder than fiction, fam
It's nuts out here
(Oi, ayy, write that shit down)
Look
I see a ting that I touched,
Tell me about talkin' stage,
Gotta tell her "Don't force it"
Beef man, pepper and salt it, me and RJ gotta pull up, no talkin'
Trap, you ain't got a rack to your name,
My bro Brick Lane, we don't know 'bout Shoreditch
Rental, I never insured it, M25, gotta whip that calmly
Man try beef with my dargy, Warzone ting how I come third party
My little nigga can't lose that cash, I drop YGs, do it like Kehlani
I don't rock Gucci or Armani, ST from ST, I can't
Squash that beef like fruit and barley,
Still got a one black star like Kwame
Three car convoy in Sutton, my mum got matching whips with Yungen
Should've made Shanei hold on suttin'
But it nevеr would've worked 'cause thе girl too stubborn
Young G's talking my name in the Ends
Gotta' tell a man "Please don't risk it"
On a right day, man ah just frisk him
On a wrong day, I'm gettin' man airlifted
I'm in Hollywood Hills with a white Rolls Royce
In the one brownin' from Compton
The Lambo parked just in front
Man pull up to the bumper and do it like Konshens
She wanna go LV, no problem
Went for the cheapest bag, that's nonsense
I took a hundred bags from Barclays bank
No cap, you can go and ask Ellie
That one mine, Bouncing Betty
The bag 4K, like a HD telly
Best believe that I'm back like Nelly
Chest petite with a back like jelly
I'm seein' man send indirects
If you wanna war man then you better be vocal
My right hand got a semi, that's local
And this brownin' I can't post on socials
My girl gotta' be far from social
I don't wanna' see her at Carni
Four-double-eight in the party
LBC how I nicked the Ferrari
Girls say we're the littiest batch in South London and,
Bro, it's a fact
Airport, we're going for bants
I hopped out the plane, I ain't going Verdansk
And moving good?
I ain't on beating or misogyny
It's mahogany, I got bougie wood
Look, Airbnb with the guys, it's a white mans face that I use to book
Chill with the stupid looks
Or it's gonna be a kettle that I use to cook
I see a ting that I touched,
Tell me about talkin' stage,
Gotta tell her "Don't force it"
Beef man, pepper and salt it, me and RJ gotta pull up, no talkin'
Trap, you ain't got a rack to your name,
My bro Brick Lane, we don't know 'bout Shoreditch
Rental, I never insured it, M25, gotta whip that calmly
Man try beef with my dargy, Warzone ting how I come third party
My little nigga can't lose that cash, I drop YGs, do it like Kehlani
I don't rock Gucci or Armani, ST from ST, I can't
Squash that beef like fruit and barley,
Still got a one black star like
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (agh!)
It's the return of the "ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"
"Yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals, well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee"
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, "how can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
Ha ha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up!
