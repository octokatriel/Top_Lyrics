# Top_Lyrics
#This project was my first experience with Google Colaboratory, data analysis with Python, Tableau, and Kaggle. I found data on Top 200 Weekly (Global) Charts on Spotify for the week of 7/23/21-71/30/21 on Kaggle and decided to find the most common words used. I searched for and copied the lyrics from 200 songs into Notebook in a .txt format and analyzed the text with Google Colabs.
